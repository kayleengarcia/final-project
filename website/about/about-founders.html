      <p><strong>Ivelice Morillo</strong> | Aside from being the founder of <em>Energy Hair Oil</em>, Ive is also a mother and daughter to a family in the Bronx, NY. She originally began growing out her curly hair in September 2008, but did not see any progress as far as length retention. After much trial and error, she conducted research that taught her about oiling the scalp and hair to moisturize and to further retain length. She began caring for her hair with 100% natural oils in September 2013. If you want to know more, you can get an in-depth look at <a href="../experience/ives-hair-journey.html">Ive's hair journey</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Kayleen Garcia</strong> | While being a student at Manhattan College, working a part-time job at Help On The Way Inc., and being a daughter to Ive, Kayleen is also the co-founder of <em>Energy Hair Oil </em>alongside her mother. Kayleen has always embraced her naturally curly hair, but never took care of it the way she has learned to now. After studying abroad in Cuba during Fall 2013, Kayleen returned from the Caribbean with sun-damaged, salt-damaged, and mistreated, broken hair. She decided to go the natural route when Ive taught her about oiling the hair and scalp.</p>
