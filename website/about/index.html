      <p class="content"> Our company is dedicated to building onto the healthy, natural hair community positively. We introduce to you the most natural way you will ever care for your hair: <strong>100% natural oils</strong>.</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
Together with our product, we base our efforts on informing, educating, and bringing awareness to women about positive ways they can nourish their hair. We want to share our first-hand knowledge from experience - woman to woman. We believe a woman’s hair is a big part of her identity and we want to make sure every single last woman has the healthiest hair her head can grow, naturally.
      <p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">The process of oiling your hair begins with energy as a concept. Energy is the intangible part of our existence we must get to know before we  begin to learn about the oil process for our hair. In order to completely reap the benefits 100% natural oils have to offer, you must <em>want</em> your hair to be at its best health. When oiling the hair and scalp, you must be<em> optimistic</em></span> and <em>trust</em> the process.</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">The energy we put into our hair and scalp then continues with a <strong>six-ounce bottle</strong> that holds a mixture of four 100% natural oils: <strong>Coconut oil, Jojoba oil, Sweet Almond oil, Castor oil</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong><center><img src="../images/oils/alltheoils.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="alltheoild" /></center><br />
      </strong></p>
<p class="content">These four oils are the bases to the beginning of a healthy hair-oiling regimen. Each one of the oils works in its own way, but essentially what is happening is that each individual strand of hair is absorbing the oil and slipping out of the scalp therefore growing faster, stronger and sturdier than ever.</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">We want all women to have the hair they were born with. Imagine you could go back to that amazing baby hair you once had. Whether your parents decided to shave your head as an infant so that you could grow thicker hair, or your mother decided your hair was too “bad” and relaxed it, we are here to tell you that no matter the texture of your hair, you too have beautiful hair that is yearning to see the light.</p>
