      <p class="content">This is image #3 in <a href="../about/ives-photo-diary.html">Ive's photo diary</a>. This is my hair after I washed it for the first time since getting my haircut.</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">I could see I had hair on my head but the density and fullness I knew I had wasn&rsquo;t there (look at my ends, empty). So I continued to research more about what happened to my hair and what I could do about it.</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content"><strong>I found out that the problem was that my hair is DRY!</strong></p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">Because of this dryness my hair had been breaking. Since I knew that I wanted to go the natural route using only natural products, in my research I found that applying natural oils and putting my hair in protective styles would help retain moisture and length. This was only the beginning. </p>
      <p class="content"><br />
        I went ahead and I embarked on this healthy, intense hair therapy journey that started September 2013. Since I already knew my hair was dry, I started applying different natural oils to my hair for moisture and giving myself scalp massages on a daily basis. </p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">I would twist my hair, and once twisted the stringy, lifeless hair was more visible, therefore making it easier to see the damage. I was able to cut off all the stringy ends, little by little of course, while I saw the twists growing thicker.</p>
      <p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="content">After a while I noticed I was retaining the length and my hair was moisturized after all these years. This process made me regress back to when I was a girl and my mother would only wash my hair every two weeks. She would brush my hair every day, apply some natural Dominican oil, and protect my hair in four ponytails with two-strand twists.</p>
      <p class="content"><br />
        Now, following the same system my mom used when I was young, the results have proven to be astonishing! It is all a very simple hair regimen.</p>
      <p class="content"><br />
        I apply  100% natural oils, give myself scalp massages, and use protective styles!<br />
